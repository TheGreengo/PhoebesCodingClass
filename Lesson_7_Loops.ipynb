If you wrote it out with the skills we've gone over so far, you would probably find yourself doing a lot of copying and pasting. If you washed dishes, you would find yourself writing some code like\n","\n","`wash(plate1)`\n","\n","`wash(plate2)`\n","\n","`wash(bowl1)`\n","\n","`wash(bowl2)`\n","\n","And so on for each of your dishes. Similarly, you might find yourself writing something like \n","\n","`read(email1)`\n","\n","`read(email2)`\n","\n","`read(email3)`\n","\n","and so on for each one of your emails. Processes like these, where we repeat a function or procedure for each element in a list (i.e. each dish in the sink, or each email in your inbox), that very early on in the history of programming, coders developed ways to \"loop\" through the elements of a list to repeat a process. These procedures are called \"for\" loops, or \"for each\" loops, and are a staple of modern programming."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### For Loop Syntax\n","Let's take our dishwashing for example, since it's your favorite thing in the whole world to do. Below is a list of our dishes that we want to wash and a loop that would go through each item in the list and print `washing <dish_name>` and then `<dish_name> has been cleaned!`.\n","\n","Note that the syntax boils down to `for <placeholder_name> in <list_name>:` and then an indented block of code. In the block of code, we can use the placeholder name where we want the values of each of our dishes to be read in."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["washing \n"," has been cleaned!\n","washing \n"," has been cleaned!\n","washing \n"," has been cleaned!\n","washing \n"," has been cleaned!\n","washing \n"," has been cleaned!\n","washing \n"," has been cleaned!\n"]}],"source":["dishes = [ \"plate\", \"plate\", \"bowl\", \"bowl\", \"cup\", \"big bowl\"]\n","\n","for dish in dishes:\n","    print(f\"washing {dish}\")\n","    print(f\"{dish} has been cleaned!\")"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Breakdown\n","When your computer runs this code, the computer essentially starts by setting `dish` equal to the first element of `dishes` and running through the indented code. Then, it sets `dish` equal to the second element of `dishes` and going through the indented block of code. And then the same for the third, and so on and so on FOR EACH element of `dishes`.\n","\n","This is all there is to for each loops.
