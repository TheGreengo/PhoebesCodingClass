As both fields fought for dominance in the new domain of academia, mathematicians won in all of the wrong ways.\n","\n","You see, originally, some people referred to programs as routines. The same way you lay out an exercise or work routine and then go through the steps one by one until your done, you make a list of tasks for the computer to do, and it goes through the instructions one by one until it's done.\n","\n","These engineers realized that many times in programs, there were sets of instructions that needed to be repeated at verious different points in the \"routine\" (not just multiple times in a row like a loop). They referred to these instruction sets as \"sub-routines\" sets of instructions that could be treated like a routine that was carried out itself multiple times in the course of a larger routine.\n","\n","Mathematicians however came along. They realized that sub-routines behaved a little bit like functions in math (though they are not functions by math's standards) and named them functions.\n","\n","And they won.\n","\n","So we're going to learn about functions."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XzAAcyc-mucC"},"source":["# Analogy: Daily Schedule\n","\n","Imagine you were writing down the daily schedule of a human as if it were code. You might see some places where things are repeated. While showering, one might rub their fingers through their hair multiple times UNTIL the shampoo is lathered up (while loop) or take another step again and again UNTIL they've arrived at their destination (while loop), or read an email, respond/delete it, and repeat this step FOR EACH item that is not read in their (for loop).\n","\n","There are some places where things are repeated, but not imediately after the last iteration. For example, one might brush their teeth in the morning and at night. They'd go through the same steps, but if you used a loop, then everything that happened between these two events would be repeated again afterwards. They probably eat three times with similar steps, but they hopefully do something in between these meals."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"imwI0aeLoePf"},"source":["# Functions\n","\n","This is where functions would be helpful. A function is essentially a named block of code. Everytime that you invoke that name, the same block of code executes. This allows you to repeat a particular block of code at different points in a larger program.\n","\n","In python, you create a function using the `def` keyword followed by the name of the function, ( ), and then a colon.
