This method of programming is incredilbly popular and especially powerful in business and software settings (much less commonplace and sometimes less useful in data analysis and research).\n","\n","Because OOP often means that EVERYTHING exists within a class, there are some important extra principles about how classes work that are worth going over. Be warned however: it can get a little weird and confusing, and in simple programming settings like the environment we're using in this \"course\" these concepts might sometimes seem more trouble than they're worth.
