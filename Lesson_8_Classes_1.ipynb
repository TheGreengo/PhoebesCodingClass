This might seem weird, but the practice is rich in real life applications.\n","\n","Imagine for example that you were writing some code in which you were dealing with the organization of a zoo. You might want to store the information on each animal somewhere in your code.\n","\n","Let's say for example that each animal needed to have its name, weight, and species stored. You could create a list to represent each animal with the first item being its name, the second its weight, and the third its species. This would work, but there's no good reason why each variable is in each place. Worse yet, in larger programs, if you had several different entities represented in lists, it might be impossible to keep track of if, for example, you had to keep track of animals, buildings, employees, guests, and so on.\n","\n","A class can help here because you could instead keep track of the animals by creating (as we will demonstrate below) your own class called \"Animal\" which keeps track of all of these different values.\n","\n","As a matter of fact, classes allow you to name different variable that belong as a part of it. This means our \"Animal\" class could contain a variable called \"weight\", and one called \"name\", and one called \"species\"\n","\n","To create a class, you use a similar format as you do when defining a function, except for with the keyword \"class\" instead of \"def\" and with no parantheses.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"pbgqrYkqb-Ml"},"outputs":[],"source":["class Animal:\n","  species = \"dog\"\n","  name = \"Echo\"\n","  weight = 40"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1gHunEy1vExs"},"source":["Now, to create a variable of type Animal, we just do the following"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"I5p01ejrvMzd"},"outputs":[],"source":["ourAnimal = Animal()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"I1WYhfmDvQ9j"},"source":["### Accessing Properties\n","\n","The \"species\", \"name\", and \"weight\" variables are called the \"properties\" of ourAnimal.

Sometimes we'll want to create an animal other than Echo, and it seems a little odd to try and set every property from scratch after creating a duplicate Echo.\n","\n","When we created a new instance of the class animal, remember how we used `Animal()` which essentially like a function call with no parameters. This is because to create an instance of a class (this is called an object), python requires a function with the same name as the class called an initializer. This function creates a member of said class whenever we assign a variable to that type.\n","\n","Since we didn't make an initializer for our class \"Animal\", python created a default initializer for us, and to do so, we had to specify what the default values of \"name\", \"species\", and \"weight\" were.\n","\n","In order to create our own initializer, we add a function named \"\\_\\_init__\" to the body of our class. I'll put an example below and describe some key features of it in the cell below it."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"8nhBe8I-yW7Z"},"outputs":[],"source":["class Animal:\n","  def __init__(self, name, species, weight):\n","    self.name = name\n","    self.species = species\n","    self.weight = weight"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5n7GkybKylt4"},"source":["### Self\n","The first thing you're probably noticing is that the word \"self\" is cropping up in all sorts of places. \"self\" is how the class definition refers to an individual instantiation of itself.\n","\n","Think of a class as a template for how to build an animal. It knows what features that animal will have, but it doesn't have any of them itself. Within the template, the term self refers to whatever the animal is that will be being made at the time.\n","\n","Because of this, no matter what, the initializer requires \"self\" as a parameter because you can't make an instance of the \"Animal\" class without there being an animal variable you're working with.\n","\n","The next couple lines of the function essentially take an input variable, and create a property for that instance of Animal with the value of the input variable.\n","\n","So if we passed in the variable `name` with a value of \"Echo\", the initializer would create a new Animal, then assign animal a `name` property and then set it equal to \"Echo\".\n","\n","Since `self` is implicitly the variable we're creating, you essentially ignore it when creating an instance of the \"Animal\" class. this is why our initializer is defined with four parameters, but called with only three.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"yqp92ViTy9rU"},"outputs":[],"source":["ourAnimal = Animal(\"Echo\", \"Dog\", 40)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"rqKihHbj1Dwc"},"source":["Like any other function, initializers can have default values."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"SKfNEOk31OwH"},"outputs":[],"source":["class Animal:\n","  def __init__(self, name, species, weight=40):\n","    self.name = name\n","    self.species = species\n","    self.weight = weight\n","\n","horse = Animal(\"Lucky\", \"Horse\")\n","print(horse.name)\n","print(horse.weight)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"KaKZ4P7ay9Mq"},"source":["# Methods\n","\n","In addition to properties, classes can have functions that are a part of them, called methods.
