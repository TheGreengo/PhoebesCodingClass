Lists are called arrays in any other language, initializer functions for classes are everywhere else called constructors, and we're going to learn about dictionaries today which are what are known, in every other language, as maps. To minimize confusion, for the rest of this lesson we'll refer to them as dictionaries.\n","\n"," Dictionaries serve a very important purpose in programming which is a little more complicated than we can succinctly dive into here. After you know c++, if you want, we can go through an intro to data structures and algorithms to understand the specialness.
